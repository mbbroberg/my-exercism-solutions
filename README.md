## My Python Exercism solutions


I'm running through the incredible [Exercism tutorials for Python](https://exercism.io/my/tracks/python), and find it important to use source control along the way as I iterate on a solution. These are my personal approaches with great feedback from coaches along the way. If you're looking to learn Python or any other programming language with help from a coach, [check out Exercism](https://exercism.io).
